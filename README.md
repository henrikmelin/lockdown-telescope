# Lockdown Telescope

Also stuck at home during this lockdown? Let's build a telescope! 

_More to be added!_


## Components
* **A telescope!** I got a second-hand Tasco 57T from the [Oxfam charity shop](https://www.oxfam.org.uk/) in Stratford-Upon-Avon (Â£15) 

* **A [Raspberry Pi 4](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/raspberry-pi-4?variant=29157087412307)** - this'll be the brains of the operation. I choose the 4 since it can operate in the [On-The-Go (OTG) mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_On-The-Go) over USB-C, which means I can plug my computer straight into it instead of connecting via WiFi should I decide to use the telescope away from my back yard once the lockdown ends. The Raspberry Pi Zero does this also, but I figured I could do with more processing power. Regardless, new things are fun. (Pimoroni - Â£33.90)

* **A camera.** [The Raspberry Pi Camera](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/raspberry-pi-camera-module-v2-1-with-mount?variant=19833929735) (Pimoroni - Â£24)

* **Three stepper motors and controller boards.** These will control altitude, azimuth and focus motion on the telescope. I got 28BYJ-48 motor with the ULN2003 motor driver board on eBay for the total price of Â£8.38!

* **Two lead screws with fittings.** These will translate the rotating motor motion to a linear motion that will move the telescope up/down (altitude) and left/right (azimuth). I got two 300 mm screws that came with both the nuts and the motor couplers (eBay  - Â£16.70)

* **An inertial measurement unit (IMU).** This will give the direction that the telescope is pointing in. I use the [ICM20948](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/icm20948) from Pimoroni's Breakout Garden suite of controllers that has a magnetometer (for the azimuth pointing), a gyroscope and accelerometer (for the altitude posting) (Pimoroni - Â£13.80)

* **A screen** for a fancy interface and exposure previews. Pimoroni makes this [really cute 240x240 display (ST7789)](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/1-3-spi-colour-lcd-240x240-breakout) as part of their Breakout Garden. (Pimoroni - Â£15)

* **Two lazy susans** with bearings for a smooth rotation. (eBay - Â£5.18)

* **A coupler** that can connect the stepper motor and the focus shaft (eBay - 3.49)

* **A prototyping board** to organise the various connections. The [Adafruit Perma-Proto HAT](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/adafruit-perma-proto-hat-for-pi-mini-kit?variant=1038451613) is excellent for this (Pimoroni - Â£4.80)

* **Bits of wood** for the telescope mount. I have quite a bit of 18 mm plywood left over from when I built my kitchen, so will consider it free of charge. ðŸŒ³

* **A bluetooth game pad.** I got the [8BitDo SN30 Bluetooth Gamepad](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/8bitdo-sn30-bluetooth-gamepad?variant=30713757597779) to use with my RetroPi setup. 


## The camera 

In order to use the Raspberry Pi Camera (v. 2.1) in a telescope, the attached lens has to be removed. The lens can be screwed out, but I found it terribly difficult to get any traction on it, so made a bit of a meal of it, ultimately using a razor blade to turn the lens out of its threading. 

I found a bit of PVC pipe to be inserted into the end of the telescope with the camera mounted with a rubber band and some [brass Raspberry Pi standoffs](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Geekworm-Raspberry-Installation-Standoff-Accessories/dp/B07MN2GY6Y/)
